My goal is to automatically convert a set of RAW images in iPhoto to JPEG, to save space.

Why not shoot in JPEG in the first place? Well, besides losing the advantages of using the RAW format, 
like having more control to fine tune the images, my camera has a couple of stuck pixels, that
iPhoto can automatically remove when shooting RAW, but not JPEG, so it's the easiest way to
get rid of those annoying red dots in the middle of my photos.

If anyone finds this useful, please let me know.
